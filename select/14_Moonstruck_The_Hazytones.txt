The moon is shining bright
Reflecting on my mind
It might have been something you said
It started spinning in my head

Yeah
I gotta get away
Away from you
I gotta get away

My insanity is compromised
I rely on your sight
Leave me back to who I am
I'm lost inside myself

Yeah
I gotta get away
Away from you
I gotta get away
