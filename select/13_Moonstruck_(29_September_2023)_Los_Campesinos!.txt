Craned my neck to see the supermoon
As the top deck gets hot boxed
Swore ourselves we'd have a Shandy Summer
We ain't slumming
No, you gotta detox to retox

When the light falls in silver slabs
Through the window, a selenograph
When the light falls I illuminate
I am moonstruck, it's a welcome fate

Night takes colour from the dusk now
Paints it crimson in my jaw (I tumble from the pedestal)
Count the straight hairs in my wet shave
Costly words from mouth of cheapskate
Sticky floors and stiff applause

When the light falls in silver slabs
Through the window, a selenograph
When the light falls I illuminate
I am moonstruck, it's a welcome fate
When the light falls in silver slabs
Through the window, a selenograph
When the light falls (the light falls, I illuminate)
I am moonstruck (I'm moonstruck, it's a welcome fate)

It's hard to find the romance
In a town not known for sunsets
Bad vibes at the toast station
Your victories, your regrets
Let us die in comfort
Laid upon electric three-piece suite
You and me, antipodes
The earth's collapse, we finally meet
